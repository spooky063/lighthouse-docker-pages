# Lighthouse via Docker

> [!NOTE]  
> This project is a workflow only.  

Go to `Actions` > `Deploy lighthouse results to GitHub Pages`, then run the workflow. Enter a URL of the website you want to check and submit.  
This workflow will generate a Github Pages with the Lighthouse report results.

I create a [gist](https://gist.github.com/spooky063/b3f119e197d9ddba899905fb8fee5be9) to show how easily this works.
